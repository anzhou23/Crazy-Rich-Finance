                    property, or investment.</p>

                        <li>Purchase Price: The actual cost paid to acquire the asset or investment.</li>
                        <li>Transaction Costs: Expenses related to the transaction process, such as brokerage fees, legal fees, and taxes.</li>
                        <li>Installation and Delivery Costs: Costs incurred in setting up and delivering the asset to its intended location.</li>

                        <li>Repair and Maintenance Costs: Any initial repairs or maintenance required to bring the asset to its operational state.</li>
                        <li>Transportation and Shipping Costs: Charges associated with transporting the asset to its destination.</li>
