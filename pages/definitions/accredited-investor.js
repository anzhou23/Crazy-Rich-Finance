            <h1>Accredited Investor</h1>
            <p>An accredited investor is an individual or entity that meets specific financial criteria defined by regulatory bodies, such as the Securities and Exchange
            Commission (SEC), allowing them to participate in certain investment opportunities that are restricted to accredited investors.</p>
            <h2 className="font-medium mt-4">What You Shoud Know</h2>
            <p>Criteria for becoming an accredited investor may include minimum income levels, minimum net worth, or professional experience in the financial industry. The exact requirements can vary
            by jurisdiction, but they are designed to ensure that accredited investors have sufficient financial means or expertise to understand and bear the risks associated with certain types of investments.</p>
            <p>Accredited investors have access to a broader range of investment opportunities that are typically unavailable to non-accredited investors. These opportunities may include private equity offerings,
            hedge funds, venture capital funds, private placements, and other types of investments that are considered higher risk, illiquid, or have higher minimum investment requirements.</p>
            <p>Regulatory bodies impose certain rules and regulations on investment offerings to accredited investors to promote investor protection and maintain fair and transparent markets. Accredited investors may
            be subject to additional disclosure requirements, filing obligations, or restrictions when participating in certain investment opportunities.</p>
            <p>Being an accredited investor comes with the responsibility of ongoing evaluation and due diligence. Accredited investors should continuously assess their investment strategies, monitor the performance
            of their investments, and stay informed about changes in market conditions or regulations that may affect their investment decisions.</p>
