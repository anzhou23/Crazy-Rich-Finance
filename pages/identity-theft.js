                    <p className="mt-4">Identity theft is a type of fraud where someone obtains and uses another person&apos;s personal information, such as their name, Social Security number,
                    credit card details, or other sensitive data, without their permission. This stolen information is then used to commit various fraudulent activities, such as making unauthorized
                    financial transactions, opening new accounts, or even assuming the victim&apos;s identity.</p>
                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 mt-4">What You Need To Know</h2>
                    <p className="mt-2">Identity theft often begins with a data breach, where cybercriminals gain unauthorized access to databases containing personal information. These breaches can
                    occur through hacking, phishing, malware, or other cyberattacks. Once the personal information is stolen, the thief can use it to impersonate the victim and carry out fraudulent
                    activities, such as applying for credit, making purchases, filing tax returns, or accessing financial accounts.</p>
                    <p className="mt-2">Identity theft can have severe financial repercussions for the victim. Their bank accounts can be drained, credit cards can be maxed out, and unauthorized loans
                    can be taken out in their name. Beyond the financial losses, identity theft can also cause emotional distress for victims. They may feel violated and unsafe, and it can take a
                    significant amount of time and effort to resolve the issues.</p>
                    <p className="mt-2">Victims of identity theft may need to work with law enforcement agencies, credit bureaus, and financial institutions to clear their name and restore their credit.
                    This process can be time-consuming and may require legal assistance.</p>
                    <p className="mt-2">Individuals can take steps to protect themselves from identity theft, such as regularly monitoring their financial accounts, using strong and unique passwords,
                    being cautious of sharing personal information online, and using security tools like two-factor authentication. Some companies also offer identity theft protection services that
                    monitor credit reports and financial activity for suspicious behavior and provide assistance in case of identity theft.</p>
